# AI Co-Scientist

An AI-powered system to assist scientists in generating novel, plausible, and testable research hypotheses through a multi-agent collaboration framework.

## Overview

AI Co-Scientist is a model-agnostic platform that uses a "generate, debate, and evolve" methodology to help scientists formulate and refine research hypotheses. The system employs multiple specialized AI agents that work together asynchronously to generate, critique, rank, and evolve hypotheses.

## Key Features

- **Model-agnostic architecture**: Supports multiple LLM backends (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT-4, local models)
- **Multi-agent system**: Specialized agents for hypothesis generation, reflection, ranking, evolution, proximity analysis, and meta-review
- **Asynchronous task execution**: Parallel processing of tasks with dynamic resource allocation
- **Tool integration**: Connects to external services (web search, AlphaFold, biomedical databases)
- **Tournament-based evolution**: Iteratively refines hypotheses through competition and improvement
- **Scientist-in-the-loop**: Natural language interface for collaborative hypothesis development
