    "background": "This research aims to solve the ARC-AGI benchmark by: 1) Designing a domain-specific language for expressing ARC transformations, 2) Using neural models to guide program synthesis search, 3) Implementing efficient test-time scaling to verify candidate solutions, and 4) Creating a modular system with perception, reasoning, and verification components. The approach will focus on abstraction capabilities rather than memorization, with the goal of achieving high accuracy within the ARC Prize competition constraints.",

The proposed 30% reduction in computational resource usage is a clear and measurable outcome that aligns well with current trends in AI research focused on efficiency. While there are critiques regarding the empirical foundation of the efficiency claim, the adaptability of the proposed method through test-time scaling techniques is a significant advantage. In contrast, Hypothesis 2, while also presenting a modular approach, lacks the same level of novelty and empirical support for its specific performance improvement claim. The complexities and potential downsides of modular systems, such as communication overhead, further weaken its position compared to the more straightforward and potentially transformative approach of Hypothesis 1."
