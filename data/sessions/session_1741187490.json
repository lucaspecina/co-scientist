      "score": 0.0,
      "rationale": "By focusing on dynamic test-time scaling, this hypothesis aligns with the feedback to emphasize this aspect. The hypothesis posits that such scaling algorithms can improve the performance by allowing the model to adaptively prioritize inputs based on their importance as determined during training, which is a critical aspect of handling the diverse and abstract nature of ARC tasks. The attention mechanisms will support this by identifying key features, while the modular framework ensures that these features are effectively utilized.",
